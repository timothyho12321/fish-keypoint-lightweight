tracker_type: botsort  # Options: ['botsort', 'bytetrack']

# BoTSORT parameters
track_high_thresh: 0.45  # High confidence threshold for first association
track_low_thresh: 0.1    # Low confidence threshold for second association  
new_track_thresh: 0.5    # Threshold for initializing new track
track_buffer: 90         # Buffer to keep lost tracks (frames before removal)
