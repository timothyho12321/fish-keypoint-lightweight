# ByteTrack configuration optimized for fish overlap scenarios

tracker_type: bytetrack

# Detection confidence thresholds
track_high_thresh: 0.45  # High confidence detection threshold
track_low_thresh: 0.1    # Low confidence detection threshold for second association
new_track_thresh: 0.5    # Threshold for new track initialization

# Track management - Extended buffer to handle temporary occlusions
track_buffer: 300        # Keep lost tracks for 300 frames (10 seconds at 30fps)

# Matching threshold - Lowered to improve re-ID after brief overlaps
match_thresh: 0.65       # IoU threshold for matching (lower = more flexible re-ID)
